# Companies House UK Proxy

Fetching data from Companies House UK via the official API requires a secure transport-layer connection (TLS 1.2) and a non-localhost domain.

This proxy implementation, based on the [Essential Server](https://github.com/TejBirringTM/EssentialServer), is designed to be hosted on a free/cost-effective computing resource to do just that.

## How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

### 2. Develop Locally

```
npm run dev
```

### 3. Deploy and Run

Currently, only Heroku deploy is supported by scripts. Feel free to add additional support.

#### Deploy on Heroku

Make sure to create a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) project. Then, install the Heroku command-line interface (CLI) on your development machine.

Finally, for the purpose of orchestrating deployments, ensure that your project (local repository) is connected to the Heroku remote repository used by Heroku to trigger deployments: `heroku git:remote -a <HEROKU APP NAME> -r <NAME OF REMOTE TO CREATE>"`

```
npm run deploy:heroku
```

#### Run

The following command is used to run the server:

```
npm run start
```

Note: When using a deployment script, such as `npm run deploy:heroku`, this command will be run automatically on the hosting machine.
